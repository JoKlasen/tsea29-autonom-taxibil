Transform image:
Perpsective needs four points that is the trapezoid-shaped to be eaxamined. Transform will make that into a square that covers the image. ( getPerspectiveTransform() )

Identify lines:
Histogram? Will detect black pixels on road but what for stops and crossroads? 
    (Seems easy, just list of pixels in image per column)
Sliding window technique tries to find two lanes, this always correct?
    (Sliding window is just code, time to write)
    (Poly.fit(x,y,degree=2) #Note that degree is 2 to achieve curvature)
